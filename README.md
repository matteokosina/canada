# Vancouver Blog 🇨🇦

Welcome to my blog about Vancouver! This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

To install the dependencies, run:

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

To start a local development server and open a browser window, use:

```
$ npm start
```

Most changes will be reflected live without needing to restart the server.

## Write a Blog Post ✍🏼

To write a blog post you can utilize the create-post script that will set you up with a base skeleton for a blog post. To do so, just run:

```bash
npm run create-post
```
